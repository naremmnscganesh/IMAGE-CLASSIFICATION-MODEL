# IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-MODEL

This repository contains an image classification model developed using Python and deep learning techniques in a Jupyter Notebook. The model is designed to classify images into distinct categories based on visual features using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## 📌 Project Overview

Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves categorizing images into predefined labels. This project builds a CNN from scratch (or with a pre-trained model, depending on implementation) to classify input images, evaluate performance, and make predictions on unseen data.

The model has been implemented using:
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas** for visualization and data manipulation

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used consists of images grouped into separate directories based on their class labels. It is loaded using `ImageDataGenerator` and split into training and validation sets.

- **Training Set**: Used to teach the model
- **Validation Set**: Used to tune the model and avoid overfitting
- Images are resized and normalized to ensure consistent input dimensions

> *Note*: The dataset can be replaced with any image classification dataset by maintaining the same directory structure.

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

The image classification model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which includes the following layers:
- Convolutional Layers
- Max Pooling Layers
- Dropout for regularization
- Flatten layer
- Fully Connected (Dense) layers
- Output layer with `softmax` activation for multi-class classification

This architecture enables the model to learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images efficiently.

## 🧪 Model Training and Evaluation

The model is compiled with:
- **Loss Function**: `categorical_crossentropy` (for multi-class classification)
- **Optimizer**: `Adam` or similar gradient-based optimizer
- **Metrics**: Accuracy

During training:
- The model is trained over several epochs
- Validation accuracy and loss are monitored
- Training and validation performance are visualized using plots

Post-training, the model is evaluated on a test dataset or new input images to check its generalization ability.

## 📈 Results

- The training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted to analyze model performance.
- Classification performance (e.g., confusion matrix, accuracy score) is calculated.
- Sample predictions on test images are visualized with corresponding labels.
